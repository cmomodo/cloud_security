### About the Project
Cloud Security Scout is a robust cloud-based application designed to enhance security in AWS environments by scanning resources for potential vulnerabilities. It incorporates comprehensive logging mechanisms to ensure all activities are tracked and monitored effectively, promoting transparency and quick issue resolution.

At its heart, the application is a user-friendly movie platform built on AWS Amplify, which simplifies frontend-backend integration. Movies are stored securely in an Aurora SQL database, providing reliable and scalable data management. To keep users engaged, a Lambda function is triggered automatically whenever a new movie is added, sending timely notifications to enhance the user experience.

This project demonstrates best practices in cloud security, AWS integration, and event-driven architecture, making it an ideal starting point for developers working on similar applications.
